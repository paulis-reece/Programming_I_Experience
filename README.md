# CPTR 141: Student Assignments Repository

Welcome to the Walla Walla University Fundamentals of Programming I git
repository for student assignments. This repository is designed to be used
with the [Code.CS](http://code.cs.wallawalla.edu/) online development
environment. 


## Contents

This repository will grow as the quarter progresses to contain
in-class exercises, homework assignments, and folders for your
projects.  In order to ensure you have the most recent assignments, 
be sure to *pull* an updated version every time you log in (see below).


## Getting New Assignments

Each day you should refresh your workspace to get the most recently 
released assignments.  To do this, right click on the `pull.sh` file in
your student141 folder and select *Run Code* from the menu.  This can also
be done in a terminal using the following commands.

```{bash}
cd ~/code/student141
./pull.sh
```


## Uploading Your Work

As you make changes to your code, be sure to save it frequently using
*Ctrl-S* or the File -> Save menu option.  When you have finished a work
session, or when you are ready to submit your work for grading, you will 
need to upload it to the WWU code repository.  To do this, right click on
the `push.sh` file in your workspace and select *Run Code* from the menu.
This can also be done in a terminal using the following commands:

```{bash}
cd ~/code/student141
./push.sh
```
