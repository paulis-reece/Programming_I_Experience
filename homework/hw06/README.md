# CPTR 141: Homework Assignment #6

## Problem Overview
In this homework you will use loops to access the individual characters of a string while you search for double letters in the word.  For example, the word *fellow* contains a double letter, while the word *gal* does not.  

Your program should perform the following steps:

1. Prompt the user to enter a word.
2. Print out a statement indicating if it does or does not have double characters.

## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You **must ** use a loop of some sort (`while`, `do`-`while`, or `for`).
2. Your solution should be able to handle a word of any length.
3. Your solution should be efficient, using looping to avoid repeating code whenever possible.
4. Your code **must** produce the same output as the included sample program, ``solution.o``.  Run this program several times trying different passwords to make sure you understand what the output should look like.  To run the program, open a new shell and type:

`./student141/homework/hw06/solution.o`


## Grade Specification

Your homework assignment assigned a grade of E (exceeds expectation), M (meets expectation), R (revise and resubmit) or N (not assessable)  as follows:

- E -- passes all Submitty tests with a score of 100% (green bars, no compiler warnings)
- M -- passes all Submitty tests, but has a score of less than 100% on some (yellow or green bars)
- R -- fails at least one Submitty test (red bars)
