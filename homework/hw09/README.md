# CPTR 141: Homework Assignment #9

## Problem Overview

In this homework assignment you will be writing three `void` functions.  These functions each take a single integer parameter.  The functions accomplish the following tasks.

* The first function prints out the sum of the numbers from 1 up to and including the number passed to it as an argument.
* The second function prints out the sum of the even numbers from 2 up to and including the number passed to it as an argument.
* The third function prints out the sum of the odd numbers from 1 up to and including the number passed to it as an argument.

To help you get started, the `main` program for this assignment has been provided to you.  You should not alter the code in the `main` function.  Your task is just to define the three missing functions within this same file.


## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must define the three functions called in the `main` program provided.
2. You may not alter the `main` program code in any way.
3. Your code must be formatted correctly (use the "Format Document" command to do this).
4. Finally, your output **must** match the output of the included program, ``solution.o``.  Run this program several times using different options to make sure you understand what that output should look like.
    To run the program, you can enter a full path to the executable in a bash shell:

`./student141/homework/hw09/solution.o`

## Grade Specification

Your homework assignment assigned a grade of E (exceeds expectation), M (meets expectation), R (revise and resubmit) or N (not assessable)  as follows:

- E -- passes all Submitty tests with a score of 100% (green bars, no compiler warnings)
- M -- passes all Submitty tests, but has a score of less than 100% on some (yellow or green bars)
- R -- fails at least one Submitty test (red bars)
- N -- no substantive changes made to template, or nothing submitted
