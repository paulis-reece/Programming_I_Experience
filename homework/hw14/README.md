# CPTR 141: Homework Assignment #14

## Problem Overview

The perimeter of a figure is computed in various ways, depending
on the type of figure.  In this homework assignment, you will develop
two functions to compute the perimeter of such figures.

* The first function computes the perimeter of a regular polygon with
a given side length and a given number of sides.  The signature for
this function is `findPerimeter(double, int)`

* The second function computes the perimeter of a circle (also called
the circumference) with a given radius.  The signature for this
version of the function is `findPerimeter(double)`

Both functions return a double equal to the perimeter.


## Solution Specification

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must correctly implement the two versions of `findPerimeter`
outlined above.

3. The function must be the only thing defined in the provided
`perimeterFunctions.cpp` file.  To test the function, you will need to make
your own header and driver files.

4. Your solution must be formatted using the "Format Document" command.


## Grade Specification

Your homework assignment assigned a grade of E (exceeds expectation),
M (meets expectation), R (revise and resubmit) or N (not assessable)
as follows:

- E -- passes all Submitty tests with a score of 100% (green bars, no
compiler warnings)
- M -- passes all Submitty tests, but has a score of less than 100% on
some (yellow or green bars)
- R -- fails at least one Submitty test (red bars)
- N -- no substantive changes made to template, or nothing submitted
